    ```

2. Navigate into the cloned directory:

    ```bash
    cd json-forms-react-seed-app
    ```

3. Install dependencies using npm:

## Usage

This seed provides a starting point for integrating JSON Forms with React. You can customize and extend it to suit your specific form rendering needs. The main files and directories to focus on are:

- `src/App.js`: Entry point for the application where JSON Forms components are used.
- `src/schema.js`: Contains the JSON Schema definition for the task entity.
- `src/uischema.js`: Contains the UI Schema definition for rendering the task form.

Feel free to modify these files and explore the JSON Forms documentation for further customization options.
